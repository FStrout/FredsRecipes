### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Remove the leading padding on the vertical scrollView and add a space between the leading edge and the first tile in each row so it initially renders with a padding but uses the whole leading edge of the view when you swipe through the horizontal scrollView.
Remove the last Divider if it's the last section.
